.strong A Little History
p When I first joined the VFW (2012) the Post staff wanted a Web site. I said I could build them one, but someone else needs to keep it updated (articles, events, etc). Well that failed! I still build <a href="https://vfwpost8600.org">vfwpost8600.org</a> and added 'Facebook' type stuff (this was before Facebook became a dominate force in social media). I also added 'Tools' to help manage the Post and generate internal and required reports. That part of the web site became the primary reason to have a web site. Managing included Accounting and Reporting. We have a canteen so Accounting requires more than a paper ledger, things like Inventory, Sales, Deposits and other information we had to provide to our accountant. Reporting included tools to try to get a handle on Community Service, Audits, Minutes, Membership, Officers, etc.

p I put up a demo site for other posts/district and Department officers to look at it, but they were not interested. Since I need to clean up our website, I just converted the department/post version to our site.

/ p I eventually pulled most of the Accounting area out of the Post web site and moved it to a separate web server. What was left was the Reporting area and the Facebook like stuff that is almost dormant. I'm now in the process of modernizing what is left. I decided to re-factor an attempt I made several years ago to build a Department version to see if there was any interest is such a tool (I couldn't get anyone to look at it, or at least give me some feedback!). For about $20 a month this prototype could be implemented on a cloud server. If there is little or no interest in the department scheme, a single Post version could be implemented at the Post level (what I currently do) for about $15 a month plus an annual domain registration fee. That option does require some technicals skills, at least in the initial setup. It also can be implemented on a local computer. I don't have high-hopes for either of the above implementations so I'll just re-factor this into a new version of what we currently use. But if anyone is interested call me and I'll provide more information.

/ p My name is Steven Alex. I've been the quartermaster at VFW Post 8600 in Gadsden for about 5 years. We are one of those evil posts that has a canteen - which is the only thing we can do to keep afloat with what was willed to us and is dying - running a bar. I've been doing web development for over 30 years. I was the IT manager of an Alabama stage agency where we had the first state agency web site in 1991. Web development was not my primary job, but I've always used that skill to demonstrate that there is usually a better way manage your operations. I've done that at our Post, but I was the only one that really used the tools I developed. 

/ p This demo does not have all the tools I've developed since many are customized for our operation. What is there are some basic things that help the Post do their reporting. I could not believe it the first time I was told I had to submit community service and other reports once a quarter. There were all these paper reports - Hospital report, Community Service, Service Officer report and a few more. All these reports had the same information - Who did what, how many hours and miles were used to accomplish something and was any Post money spent. You don't run any organization efficiently pushing paper - this is just an effort to at least have someone think out of the box if there is a better way.

/ p Please take a look around. There is no data that you can destroy - it's just a demo and can be replaced. There could be errors - I've used a lot of new tools that I am not as proficient in as I'd like. I'll gladly accept any feedback, good or bad. You can reach me at:
