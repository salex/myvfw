.strong A Little History
p When I first joined the VFW (2012) the Post staff wanted a Web site. I said I could build them one, but someone else needs to keep it updated (articles, events, etc). Well that failed! I still build <a href="https://vfwpost8600.org">vfwpost8600.org</a> and added 'Facebook' type stuff (this was before Facebook became a dominate force in social media). I also added 'Tools' to help manage the Post and generate internal and required reports. That part of the web site became the primary reason to have a web site. Managing included Accounting and Reporting. We have a canteen so Accounting requires more than a paper ledger, things like Inventory, Sales, Deposits and other information we had to provide to our accountant. Reporting included tools to try to get a handle on Community Service, Audits, Minutes, Membership, Officers, etc.

p I eventually pulled most of the Accounting area out of the Post web site and moved it to a separate web server. What was left was the Reporting area and the Facebook like stuff that is almost dormant. I'm now in the process of modernizing what is left. I decided to re-factor and attempt I did several years ago to build a Department version to see if there was any interest is such a tool. For about $20 a month this prototype could be implemented on a cloud server. If there is little or no interest in the department scheme, a single Post version could be implemented at the Post level (what I currently do) for about $15 a month plus and annual domain registration fee. That option does require some technicals skills, at least in the initial setup. It also can be implemented on a local computer. I don't have high-hopes for either of the above implementations so I'll just re-factor this into a new version of what we currently use. But if anyone is interested call me and I'll provide more information.
