    LaPoint brought up Mid Winter conference attendance. Requirement's being changed

    Commander status,Commander LaPoint's fees may be offset by Department reimbursement.
    Reservations need to be made before first of year. Several other members requested
    to attend, but their lodging (if payed by Post) must be reimbursed to the Post.
    Motion made and seconded (LaPoint, Alex) to allocate registration fees ($60 each)
    for up to six members and up to 6 nights lodging (≈$99 each) for member to attend
    conference. (Note: Some attendees may not require lodging and some may not have
    to pay registration fee if only attending training.) Motion passed.\r\n      li
    Commander LaPoint brought up the request for reinstatement of the Post’s AUX that
    was discussed last month. There was some discussion on points made about the differences
    between Post and Axillary requirements, but all agreed that the membership should
    vote on this versus a single member (Commander). Members also voiced their support
    for the efforts of those current and potential Axillary members requesting reinstatement
    and how they can help the Post and the Veterans of Foreign Wars mission. Comrade
    Bozeman made a motion (seconded by Shelly) that we accept the reinstatement request,
    contingent upon meeting all reinstatement requirements of the Department Axillary,
    and that the necessary paper work, including the minutes of this meeting be forwarded
    to the Department Auxiliary by Friday, December 15th, 2017.  Motion passed by
    a unanimous show of hands (12-0).\r\n  \r\n  li \r\n    strong Good of the Order:\r\n
    \   ul \r\n      li Lorena Beam having retirement party in Montgomery Jan 6th\r\n
    \     li Commander LaPoint brought up several membership items, mainly dealing
    with the Council of Administration. He brought up the technically incorrect requirement
    that Posts with canteens require 150 members to have the canteen open (really
    a Class I Club License). He is going to attempt a compromise on the number of
    members required be lowered. Resistance may come from the Department bureaucracy
    that doses not want to change anything. As long as a Post is in good standing
    (completes their programs/requirements), there should not be any restrictions.
    All canteens are not bad and all carnivals are not good - why discrimination.\r\n

  content: "A special meeting has been called for Tuesday, Feb 14th 2017  at 6PM.
    The sole purpose of the meeting is discussing and voting on relocating the Post
    home. The special meeting is in lieu of a general membership meeting, with the
    exception of any petitions for membership or new business requiring funding approval.\r\n\r\nThe
    discussion will try to make a case for attempting to sell the current facility
    and moving to an adequate existing facility, or building a new facility. Opposing
    cases are welcome if they define pragmatic solutions.  A vote to attempt the sale
    will requires 2/3 majority of the members present at the meeting. \r\n\r\nSee

    The new band (Outlaws) were brought in on a trial basis. We had a few good weeks,
    but they have decided that with the current makeup of the band (and 14 people
    the last dance), they can't draw the number of people we need. He is trying to
    put together another band that hopefully will attract a larger crowd.\r\n        li
    Will try Karaoke on Saturday until we form or find a new band.\r\n        li Reported

    Templeton, from Emma Sanson placed first in District, and placed first in the
    State. Teacher Huffy Vaughn placed first in District but didn't move on. Working
    on awards and certificates.\r\n  li \r\n    strong Reading of Official Communications:
    \r\n    | General Order #7 was read to membership and some items were brought
    up for discussion (Made clear that there is only one kind of VFW membership -
    Active. There are no Temporary, Associate, Honorary, Courtesy or any other type
    of membership defined.  Mid winter conference in Opilika on Jan 19. We have 5
    scheduled to attend. Remember, General Orders are available available on the Departments
    Web Site: http://alvfw.org.\r\n  li\r\n    strong Unfinished Business:\r\n    ul
    \r\n      li $712 left to finish floor were the old bathroom was located in the

    Mr Riley about door, can't fix must be new.\r\n      li For Sale sign has has
    been purchased and posted. We ave gotten a couple curiosity inquiries. Item closed
    last month.\r\n      ll All-American sign purchased and waiting for better weather
    to install.\r\n\r\n  li \r\n    strong New Business:\r\n    ul\r\n      li Karaoke
    will be turned over the Auxillary. The agreement is that they are in charge, but
    will (donate?/pay?)  $25 to the Post to cover cleaning and use of the facilities.
    No vote required.\r\n      li The Axillary, when they quit? or were suspended?
    in November 2016, donated $1,000 to the post. Comrade Alex made an unapproved
    statement that if they were reinstated, which they had until February 2018 to
    do, that the donation would be returned. Since the Auxiliary had not yet started
    banking, the Post wrote two checks to National for $360.50 for them to pay National
    the dues they collected for new members. Comrade Alex made motion that we donate
    $639.50 to the Post's newly reformed Axillary. Seconded by Shelly, motion passed.\r\n
    \     li We did pay $300 under 'Emergency Repairs' to patch holes in asphalt.\r\n
    \     li Commander LaPoint made a motion the under the Manual of Procedures that
    we delegate the approval of any fund raising activities, or solicitation of funds,
    for the rest of the year to the house committee. Second by Bozeman, motion passed
    with one no vote!\r\n      li House Committee 2 vacancy needs to be filled. Comrade
    Shelly nominated Danny Thornton for House Committee 2. He accepted. Motion made
    and passed to elect Danny Thornton to the House Committee 2 position.\r\n      li
    Commander LaPoint brought up we need to tighten up our minutes to reflect what
    expenses were approved and for who (when its in regard to reimburse member for
    attending meeting etc).\r\n     \r\n  li \r\n    strong Good of the Order:\r\n
    \   ul \r\n      li Comrade Holland would like to clean up the old shed area.\r\n
    \     li Discussed members buying/donating things for post. There have been quit
    a few items donated recently, and some have said maybe we should reimburse them.
    All funds, except for $1000 weekly operating budget for the canteen and emergency
    repairs needs to be approved by the membership. There maybe situations which call
    for \"You shouldn't have done that, but it really helped.\", but they should not
    be the norm. \r\n      li Comrade Homes started a lengthly discussion about our
    business problems. We need to get more serious on what we are going to do and
    how long we are going to continue operating the canteen at a loss. He had no answer,
    but action needs to be taken. Commander LaPoint said the House committee needs
    to, as soon as possible provide to the membership on suggested actions/options.
    We keep hoping that a band will solve some of our problems, but Comrade Holmes
    pointed that we've been down that road and he's not sure we'd get anymore participation
    if we didn't charge anything for the dance. We have to find out the reasons people
    are not coming to both the Dance and the Canteen. The house committee will discuss
    and report to the membership the next meeting.\r\n      li Next meeting February
    13th.\r\n\r\n  li Closing Ceremonies performed and meeting Adjourned by Commander
    LaPoint at 7:30 PM.\r\n\r\n\r\n.strong Steven Alex\r\n\r\n.strong Adjutant"

  title: Making a Case for Relocating Post Home
  content: ".slim\r\n\r\np Our Post is surviving, but just barely. Something needs
    to be done if our Post is to exist past the next year. During a Special Post Membership
    Meeting on February 14th, 2017 at 6:00PM a plan will be presented to gather our
    assets and downsize the Post. A plan is just that, nothing can be done unless
    the membership agrees to the plan. The plan is open for discussion and modification.
    This article outlines some of the factors that resulted us to conclude that action
    needs to be taken, or at least discuss it with the membership.\r\n\r\ndl.outline\r\n
    \ dt The VFW\r\n  dd In case you have not heard, the VFW, along with other Veterans
    groups, have been losing membership in recent years. While there have been numerous
    opinions given on why this is happening, one is that we are between wars! Since
    membership in the VFW is restricted to those who have served in a combat zone
    in a Foreign War, the VFW needs 'wars' to survive - not a very good reason to
    exist. There have been wars and there are veterans eligible for membership, but
    all posts are struggling with membership.\r\n\r\n  dd The WWII vets are down to
    a very few. The Korean Vets are not far behind. Those two groups made up a large
    portion of those who joined the VFW at some point in their lives, when they realized
    they had something to share with their comrades - even if it was just a beer.
    \r\n\r\n  dd The Vietnam vets took a long time to overcome the Country's disgust
    with a political war that they did not create, but they only participated in because
    of the laws of the land. I am sure the VFW membership dropped between WWII and
    Korean wars to the Vietnam war. The Vietnam vets eventually took over, but now
    their numbers are going down and we are again between wars.\r\n\r\n  dd Other
    political wars, Iraq/Afghanistan have placed those vets in the same position as
    the Vietnam vets - they are really not ready to share their memories. That is
    the sad state of Wars and what it does to those who participate. Until we can
    get the younger generation to take over the reins, we need to do something if
    we are to survive, if we really want to survive. \r\n\r\n  dt Our Post\r\n  dd
    The majority of the VFW Posts are run by a few of the elected Line Officers. Most
    volunteer for this responsibility, and like any elected position will soon burn
    out if they do not have the support of the membership. Like many other posts,
    we have a difficult time filling post Officers, let alone having them give up
    the time and effort to do what has to be done to exist. Lets look at some of the
    factors that resulted in coming to the conclusion that we must downsize:\r\n  dd\r\n
    \   dl.outline\r\n      dt Income\r\n\r\n      dd Our only source of income is
    the Post's Canteen and events at the Post (Dance, Karaoke, etc). Many Posts do
    not have Canteens and derive their income by renting their facilities or property.
    We do not have that luxury. Fund raising drives like Buddy Poppy drives raise
    money, but money that cannot be used to pay the bills, only to help Veterans in
    Need. If we don't have a profitable canteen, we will soon run out of funds to
    keep the Post Home open, with or without a canteen.\r\n\r\n      dd After the
    disaster of what a former regime did a few years ago, spending us out of oblivion,
    we did recover. Through the efforts of a few, we went from -$1,200 dollars in
    the bank to a high of over $70,000 - although using revenue generating methods
    that were on the edge of legality. We've been averaging around $60,000 for the
    last year, but over $20,000 of that is in the Relief Fund.\r\n\r\n      dt Membership\r\n\r\n
    \     dd Due to an Alabama ABC law, our Post must have 150 paid members to keep
    its Class I Club license. We are currently at 168 members and it does approach
    dropping below 150 at different times of the year. Again, without a canteen we
    can't exist in the current facilities. In the last four or five years our membership
    dropped from almost 300 members down to an average of about 160 members.\r\n\r\n
    \     dt Facilities and Expenses\r\n      dd\r\n        ol\r\n          li We
    have over 7,000 square feet of usable space for our members and guests and another
    2,500 square feet of unusable space that was condemned at one point. Most of the
    space has to be heated or cooled under controlled conditions (when used). The
    cost of utilities alone is about $1,600 a month, or $400 a week\r\n          li
    The canteen is open 67 hours a week. We need employees to run the canteen.  Wages
    and taxes are about $10 and hour or $670 a week.\r\n          li Licenses, Insurance
    and Fees are about $10,000 a year or another $500 a week\r\n          li The building
    is old, inefficient and things break. You also have expenses for things like canteen
    supplies and equipment that average $200 a week.\r\n          li With just those
    items we need $1,270 a week just to stay open. In order to stay open you have
    to buy inventory to sell. Thats another $600 a week.\r\n          li We are now
    up to the fact that the Canteen must produce about $2,000 a week to exist, and
    we really need about $2,500 to allow for some growth and have a cushion.\r\n      dd
    We've been meeting those goals over the last few years, but there has been a steady
    decline.\r\n      dd Our Saturday dance and Sunday Karaoke have gone from packed
    houses years ago to about 20 to 30 participants (in a 5,000 sq ft hall!). We love
    our participants, but do not make enough money on the events to pay for the inefficient,
    albatross heating and cooling system. Just as we are between wars, dance customers
    are between generations. The younger generation does not want to hear what the
    older generation wants to hear and vice versa. \r\n      dd We have no front door!
    \ Driving by the post it looks like an abandoned building - unless the 20 or 30
    people are attending the Dance.\r\n      dd The canteen area is too small and
    the dance hall is too big. Both are inefficiently laid out.\r\n      dd We do
    not need 7,000 sq ft to support 160 member of which only about 20% ever show up
    at the post (most only once in a blue moon) and only about 6% show up at meetings
    that are designed to control what the post can do.\r\n\r\n      dt Some other
    issues, past history and what we've tried\r\n      dd There is competition between
    Post 2760 and Post 8600. There was an attempt to merge the posts a few years ago
    but \"Petty differences and stubbornness\" prevented that action from occurring.
    The competition has only gotten worse. We really need to merge at some point,
    but probably not until both Posts conclude that it can be done for the Good of
    the Order.\r\n      dd\r\n        ol\r\n          li The Post was offered over
    $1,000,000 for the property several years ago. Note, I said property, not building
    \ - the building is worthless. The membership turned down the offer.\r\n          li
    The property has an appraised tax value at almost $600,000. That make the true
    value close to the $1,000,000 offered several years ago.\r\n          li We’ve
    inquired into getting the property appraised, but the cost of that is about $30,000,
    nearly half of the cash we have on hand.\r\n          li We’ve inquired on having
    the condemned area (old canteen) fixed (and to have a front door!). The front
    wall is crumbling with over 1 inch cracks. The bathrooms were disabled years ago
    and date back 30+ years. The front of the building was originally a porch and
    was closed in by someone who, lets just say didn’t know what they were doing.
    There is a 1 foot drop in elevation between the front of the building and 20 feet
    into the building (the front porch!) The electrical system has been re-wired by
    amateurs that even scares me - a shade tree electrician!\r\n          li The estimated
    cost of reclaiming the old canteen was over $130,000 and that was a low estimate,
    only guessing on the front wall.\r\n          li There is also the option of tearing
    down the old canteen and have at least a side door into a remodeled canteen, but
    that would probably be close to $100,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n  dt The Plan - What we want
    to do.\r\n\r\n  dd While the property is not a great location for a VFW, there
    is a hospital only a few blocks away. There are rumors about the hospital being
    purchased by a renowned Birmingham hospital. That makes the property a good location
    for a medical facility.  Again the building is worthless, but the property may
    not be.\r\n\r\n  dd Given that we do not have money to get an appraisal and put
    the building up for sale with a commercial agent,  we would like to attempt to
    sell the property by putting the building up for sale-by-owner. We really want
    to only accept bids but may have to put up a price. Our low is about $600,000
    and suggesting $750,000 or best offer.\r\n\r\n  dd What if we get $600,000? Either
    move to an exiting facility in the area or build a new facility for approximately
    $250,000. A facility that is large enough for our downsizing effort. The rest
    of the money goes in the bank and hopefully the Iraq and Afghanistan vets will
    take over and make things better.\r\n\r\n  dd Optionally we could just close the
    post home, save some money for Veterans in Need and have meeting each month at
    some restaurant until the money runs out. \r\n\r\n  dd Again, it is just a plan.
    If we do not receive any bids, nothing is lost except for time and effort. We
    can continue and hopefully get more membership support.\r\n\r\n  dd If we are
    forced to close down, the results would be the State Department taking over the
    property and doing what they want with the profits.\r\n\r\nstrong Steven Alex,

    \   dl.print-dd\r\n      dt Special meeting called to vote on putting the Post
    home up for sale\r\n      dd Letter mailed to 168 Post members on February 3rd
    calling special meeting and specifying the date and time.\r\n      dd A document,
    'Making a Case for Relocating the Post Home', referenced in the letter and published
    on the Post's web site, was distributed as the main talking points.\r\n      dt
    Main points\r\n      dd We have more building than we need for our membership.
    We need to downsize.\r\n      dd Sales are down.\r\n      dd Membership is down.\r\n
    \     dd At this rate, we won't have a Post, let alone a Post home within a year.\r\n
    \     dt Quartermaster Comments\r\n      dd Discussed ABC law requiring 150 paid
    members to have a Class II Club license.\r\n      dd We have 168 members, but
    we had 12 letter come back as undeliverable. We don't know where they are, so
    we could down to 154 members, include 2 deceased members we just found out about.\r\n
    \     dd While our sales and assets are down, we're not in dire need, but if we
    don't do something soon, we may not be around next year.\r\n      dd We had about
    $70,000 in bank for the last three years. We're down to $60,000 now ,but it will
    probably be down to $55,000 by end of year.\r\n      dd Our only source of income
    is the Canteen - without it we have no income.\r\n      dd We have options. We
    could obtain a Lounge License instead of a Private Club license, but there are
    problems. We could tear down the old area and make some improvements, but that
    would require borrowing money.\r\n      dd We are not voting on selling the building
    tonight, just requesting open bids.\r\n      dd If we receive an offer that is
    acceptable (enough to build a new home or relocate and put some money in the bank),
    that offer would be discussed and voted on at another meeting.\r\n      dt Commander
    Comments\r\n      dd Looked at several existing facilities in area in the 5,000
    SqFt range. Range is between $150,000 and $300,000.\r\n      dd Discussed the
    inefficiencies of the current facility and what we've considered doing. We just
    don't have the money do modernization without going in debit.\r\n      dd Discussed
    not having a front door, the place looks like an abandoned building.\r\n      dd
    Building a new 5,000 SqFt facility would be about $250,000 - not counting property.\r\n
    \     dd If we get offer over $600,000, we could downsize, have an more efficient
    facility and put up to $250,000 in bank awaiting the the younger members to take
    over.\r\n      dt Open discussion\r\n      dd \r\n        | Some discussion was
    about running the post and not selling the home. Those will just be briefly touch
    on.\r\n        ul\r\n          li If we move, will there still be a dance floor?
    Yes, probably smaller, but what we can efficiently do in 5,000 SqFt\r\n          li
    I never see any Officers at the Canteen. The officer's job is not to socialize,
    but to run the Post.\r\n          li Are the places you looked at comparable to
    the current facility? Yes we just looked at a few.\r\n          li Has there been
    any interest in this property? The has been in the pasts, but that's what we're
    trying to find out. We don't know. We think there may be.\r\n          li You
    wouldn't sell this without having another place? No. We hope to have enough time
    to move. IF it was a really good offer, but could move to a temporary facility
    while we locate a permanent facility.\r\n          li We're all seem to be fairly
    old, what are we doing to attract younger members? Sports bar? We do have TV on
    sports. It's just not time yet for younger member to give up time needed.\r\n
    \         li Comments on work that current officers do.\r\n          li Comment
    on history of what post went through in past and post doing the same thing - talking
    about moving remodeling. The problem is not the building, it is getting members
    and having them participate. Concluded that membership is the root problem and
    it's everyones job to get new members.\r\n          li Could we contract out running
    the bar and facility?  We still have to have control and it has not worked at
    other location in the past. Could we have food? We can only do so much, 4 or 5
    people can't do it all. You just burn out. Or you have to pay someone to do the
    food and hope you have customers.\r\n          li Comments from Sr Vice. The AUX
    closed down because they couldn't fill officer positions. We're getting to the
    same position. He gave some history but came down to the bottom line. Our expenses
    are exceeding our income and the expenses are just running the place. We need
    to do something or we're going to loose it all.\r\n          li Some comments
    on the Sports Bar, Jefferson's approach. We're a private club and can't cater
    to just the public.  We have to have members in here for guests, or we could be
    in trouble. Also talked about Iraq and Afghanistan vets and it just not time yet.
    We do need everyone to recruit and we gave everyone membership applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n
    \ li.strong After discussions were concluded, a request for a motion was made.
    Comrade Holmes motioned that we authorize putting building up for sell. If we
    get buyers, we'll bring it up to membership to vote on accepting any offers meeting
    our minimum requirements.\r\n  ul\r\n    li Comrade Holland point of order. How
    long will the building be up for sale, you don't have a limit. We will set a limit
    of 6 months. Suggest and open bid, much like eBay. If we don't get an acceptable
    offers in that time, it' time to go to the next plan.\r\n    li Motion second
    by Comrade Shelly\r\n    li Motion passed unanimously with 14 votes by show of
    hands.\r\n    li We will keep membership up date on progress and report at monthly
    membership meetings. Minutes are published on the post's web site.\r\n\r\n  li

    reports given by Chairman Shelly.\r\n        p \r\n          | Addressed our money
    problems in some detail. The For Sale sign has been up and we've had a few inquires,
    but nothing more. We continue to have band/dance and, karaoke problems. Still
    having problems raising funds and canteen sales. Our letter to the membership
    requesting input and participation was a failure. It's time to stop talking and
    take action. The best thing we have is our location. We don't have time to sell
    and need to take advantage of our location. We could borrow money and fix the
    place up: have a front door and a front face that does not look like a self-storage
    building; have a canteen layout that actually makes sense. We are still considering
    changing our liquor license to a Special Retail License instead of a Club License.
    Need to make decisions and need to make them quickly.\r\n        p\r\n          |
    Options are to borrow money for renovation and develop new sources of income or
    die. Possibly a Cafe, hall rental and other ideas have all been discussed. The
    Doctors office next, which we though was for sale, is not. That was ideal to join
    the properties as one.\r\n\r\n          | New band coming in for six week trial,
    Alabama Backwater. We keep trying.\r\n\r\n          | Real Estate agent coming
    tomorrow and is going to try to give us an estimate on the value of the property.\r\n\r\n
    \         | Need to make appointment with ABC and get details on Special Retail
    License.\r\n      li Commander LaPoint. Office hours at Department have changed.\r\n
    \ li \r\n    strong Reading of Official Communications: \r\n    | General Order
    #8 was read to membership and some items were brought up for discussion. Commander
    Doughty home coming April 13-15 in Selma. Council of administration on 15th State
    Convention May 31 June 2. Some discussion on Buddy Poppy drive for Memorial Day
    and conflict.\r\n  li\r\n    strong Unfinished Business:\r\n    ul \r\n      li

    New Business:\r\n    ul\r\n\r\n      li Shelly made motion that we look into obtaining
    a loan to remodel building. No money at this point, just investigate if we could
    obtain a loan. What would it cost, what payments would be and if we could afford
    them. Motion seconded by Beam. Motion carried.\r\n      li Commander LaPoint made
    motion to purchase Program awards (PP, VOD, Firefighter, Teacher) certificates,
    medals and cash awards for winners. Total cost approximately $1,600. Seconded
    by Shelly. Motion passed.\r\n      li Commander LaPoint. Last month a motion was
    made and passed that lumped most fund raising activities into one item that would
    be good for a year. He feels he made a mistake doing that and would like to rescind
    the item. He feels that some of the recent efforts at fund raising have tried
    to circumnavigate the system and he was not informed. Made motion to rescind the
    item, seconded by Holmes. A rather lengthly, and somewhat contentiousness discussion
    followed. No vote was taken, but it appears that, until clarification on Section
    214 of the MOP in that allows a yearly blanket vote on certain items (delegated
    to the House Committee), all fund raising activities must be approved by the Post
    Membership.\r\n     \r\n  li \r\n    strong Good of the Order:\r\n    ul \r\n
    \     li Comrade Danny Thornton, with his work with MOA, discussed and effort
    underway to form a coalition of all military service organizations in the state
    (VFW, American Legion, MOA, etc) to promote legislation in the State of Alabama
    that will be beneficial to military members,  families and veterans. Bringing
    this it up and requests that the Post, and the VFW in general, take part in the
    effort.\r\n      li Next month is nomination of Officers\r\n      li Membership.
    District at 96.5%. We're almost in last place in district (91.5%). Need to start
    working on membership. Had discussion on Post buying memberships, and status of
    current membership.  Comrade Holmes brought up some points on why we are having
    trouble. Comrade Campbell reached out to to younger members for ideas on what
    to do to them more involved.\r\n      li Next meeting March 13th.\r\n\r\n  li

  title: What are we going to do?
  content: ".slim\r\np After 5 or 6 years of helping to keep this place alive I come
    to the conclusion that we have to make drastic changes, but we can't afford them.
    We've existed, but just barely. We need to start doing some things and stop doing
    others. At least change how we are doing some things. For now we are just a Bar
    and Bar's are not doing good in our current climate, but that is all we have.
    We've lost patrons for unknown reasons and need to get them back, or find new
    ones. I'd include members - but they have even seemed to have left us. I wish
    I knew how to get them back.\r\nh5.strong Stop Doing\r\ndl.indent-dd\r\n  dt Bands\r\n
    \ dd.indent\r\n    |We've wasted more time trying to make bands work and have
    failed at every attempt. A spurt every once in a while is nice, but the cost in
    time, money and people is not worth the effort. At least for what we've tried.
    We have to stop this until we have a need.\r\n  dd.indent\r\n    |Bands need to
    be limited to special events, and we can't have one every week!. A goal would
    be once a month, but maybe we need  6 or more a year. Special events should be
    <strong>donation</strong> events open to the public, but we have to have a minimum
    donation and how do we do that? Minimum donation for admittance?\r\n  dt Food\r\n
    \ dd.indent\r\n    |It takes people, money and time. We've don't have the volunteers
    and it comes down to the same few - most approaching burn-out. We have a kitchen,
    but barely. The kitchen expansion would be great, but we don't have the money.
    Food has to be for Special events only.\r\n  dt TV's\r\n  dd We pay over $330
    a month for 5 TV's that 2 or 3 would do. Maybe we need to cut the cord, or go
    down to minimum features and expand using fire sticks or something. We need HBO
    to get the SEC channel, that's dumb.\r\n  dt Karaoke\r\n  dd I don't want to stop
    it, just turn it over to the Axillary - totally - and that's more than Bonnie.\r\n
    \ dd Karaoke from the bar standpoint is a loser - they don't support the bar.
    From the customer standpoint It's a loser in that you can only have about 25-30
    singers or they get pissed off because they can only sing a couple times. That's
    all I have to say about that! (think Forest Gump!)\r\nh5.strong Need to change\r\ndl.indent-dd\r\n
    \ dt Bar Manager - POS\r\n  dd For years we've payed the Bar Manager $200 a week
    to run the bar. I didn't have a real problem with this because our process required
    an average of 2 hours a day (14 hours a week) to manage sales, other income, inventory,
    management etc. That's about $15 an hour - we are not getting 14 hours a week.
    The problem is half of the work could be taken care of by a more modern approach.\r\n
    \ dd Over the years I've built Web tools that made some of those jobs easier.
    Problem is if I croak tomorrow, you'll have to live with what I did and when something
    breaks or changes, you're shit out of luck!\r\n  dd Most of what I've done could
    be handled by a modern POS system that would replace our 10+ year old cash register
    and stuff I've done.\r\n  dd A POS could replace:\r\n  dd\r\n    ul\r\n      li
    Inventory, It knows, by brand or at least class what you have and sold. Requires
    Bar Manager to stop using paper and use the POS system.\r\n      li Time accounting.
    Work schedules are in the POS and a time clock manages hours worked.\r\n      li
    Sales/Accounting reports replaces most of what I've written - and I could die
    tomorrow!\r\n  dd At $75 a month I'm sure we could make the Bar Manager's more
    efficient and have a slight reduction in pay to offset the cost.\r\nh5.strong
    Start Doing\r\ndl.indent-dd\r\n  dt Start with a night that patrons want to come
    to the bar!\r\n  dd Every week is different. Mondays suck most of the time, but
    sometimes not. Fridays or usually decent days. We compete with 2760 and their
    dance and the old foggies who are pissed off with our band go there.\r\n  dd I've
    spend many Fridays at a bar after a work week - it just seemed natural then -
    and probably still does.\r\n  dd Friday should be happy hour all day,\r\n  dd
    Bring in Kim from about 5 till 8+ for DJ/Karaoke. I'd even consider paying her
    if we ever get started. \r\n  dd We have to start somewhere and Friday is one
    option - mine - but maybe someone has a better idea. M-T just does not work. SS
    is dead without Band/Karaoke, but they don't work\r\n  dt Special events\r\n  dd
    Need to be promoted in advance. $10-$15 admission. Even some food, but maybe for
    sale. We have New Years, Valentines, St Patrick's, Spring Fling, Summer's Coming,
    School's out, Independence Day, Football's coming, Football's here, Halloween,
    Turkey Day, Christmas - and others. Just don't overdo it \r\n\r\n"
